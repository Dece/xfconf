    <para>
      Xfconf is a hierarchical (tree-like) configuration system where the
      immediate child nodes of the root are called "channels".  All settings
      beneath the channel nodes are called "properties."
    </para>

    <para>
      Valid channel and property names are composed of the ASCII US-English
      uppercase characters A-Z, lowercase characters a-z, numerals 0-9, the
      dash (-), and underscore (_).  No other characters are allowed for
      channel names.  The less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;) characters
      (aka "angle brackets") are also allowed in property names, but not
      in channel names.
    </para>

    <para>
      Property names are referenced by their "full path" underneath their
      channel, for example: "/main/history-window/last-accessed".  Of course,
      when querying a particular property, the channel must be specified
      separately as well.
    </para>

    <para>
      Both channel and property names are case-insensitive.  For example,
      the following four all refer to the same property:

      <programlisting>
        Channel: ExampleApp, property: /main/history-window/last-accessed
        Channel: EXAMPLEAPP, property: /main/history-window/last-accessed
        Channel: ExampleApp, property: /Main/History-Window/Last-Accessed
        Channel: exampleapp, property: /MAIN/history-window/last-accessed
      </programlisting>
    </para>
  </sect1>
