    <title>Property Lockdown (Kiosk Mode)</title>

    <para>
      The Xfconf daemon supports a so-called "kiosk mode" or "lockdown mode"
      such that certain configuration properties or certain channels can be
      locked from user modification.  In this case, the locked values are
      provided by a system administrator in the form of a settings file (in
      the same format as the user's settings files) in a system read-only
      location.
    </para>

    <para>
      Not all backends may support kiosk/lockdown mode.  Please see the
      documentation corresponding to your configuration backend for
      information on how to lock down user configuration values.
    </para>

    <para>
      (If you're unsure which backend, you're probably using the
      "Per-channel XML" backend.)
