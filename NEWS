Xfce 4.7.0
==========

  * Add prefetching and caching support to XfconfChannel.  Should speed
    things up a bit on app startup, and avoid blocking waiting on DBus
    in other cases.


Xfce 4.6.2
==========

  * Speed up startup of many apps that use bindings by retrieving the
    initial value of the binding asynchronously.


Xfce 4.6.1
==========

  * Be a bit safer when writing out channel xml files: flush data to disk
    using fdatasync()/fsync() before renaming over the old file.
  * Updated translations: pl, es, it, gl, pl, pt, uk


Xfce 4.6.0
==========

  * Remove unimplemented --import and --export functions from xfconf-query
  * Fix encoding bug with xfconf-query input (Bug #4622)
  * Updated translations: ba, ca, cs, da, de, en_GB, es, fr, gl, hu, id, it, ja,
    nb, pl, pt_PT, sv, tr, zh_CN


Xfce 4.6rc1 (Xfce 4.5.99.1)
===========================

  * Don't translate "true" and "false" in the xfconf-query output.
  * Updated translations (cs, da, fi, fr, nl, pt_BR, sv, zh_CN)


Xfce 4.6beta3 (Xfce 4.5.93)
===========================

  * Install xfconfd to $(libexecdir) instead of $(bindir).
  * Fix perl bindings link order on Cygwin (bug 4735).
  * Allow passing arbitrary options to the perl bindings' Makefile.PL
    generation script (bug 4735).
  * Updated translations: Michal Várady (cs), SZERVÁC Attila (hu),
    Daniel Nylander (sv), Terje Uriansrud (nb), Carles Muñoz Gorriz (ca),
    Abel Martín (es), Maximilian Schleiss (fr), Og Maciel (pt_BR),
    Eren Turkay (tr)
    

Xfce 4.6beta2 (Xfce 4.5.92)
===========================

  * Add xfconf_channel_new_with_property_base() to restrict a channel
    to a subset of the property tree.
  * Add a dbus message filter to xfconfd that catches dbus daemon
    disconnect signals and flushes channels before xfconfd gets
    killed (bug 4487).
  * Change libxfconf GObject bindings API slightly to use gulong IDs
    for each binding to be used when removing bindings.  Extend the
    unbind functions a bit.
  * Bump libxfconf interface version due to incompatible change.
  * Add libxfconf perl bindings.
  * Remove xfconf_channel_remove_property() and
    xfconf_channel_remove_properties().
  * Only treat the XML file under $XDG_CONFIG_HOME as a "user" file,
    and treat all others as system files.  This fixes the problem where
    Xfce-installed defaults get read *after* the user's config when
    Xfce is installed to a user-writable prefix (bug 4592).
  * Fix build on Cygwin and other platforms that actually care about
    library link order (bug 4559).


Xfce 4.6beta1 (Xfce 4.5.91)
===========================

  * Remove xfsettingsd (moved to xfce4-settings package).  This removes
    xfconf's gtk+ dependency entirely.
  * Add xfconf_channel_get() which returns an XfconfChannel singleton
    object that lives until calling xfconf_shutdown().
  * Add xfconf_channel_reset_property(), which is a replacement for the
    'remove' functions.  This more accurately describes what 'remove'
    actually does in the presence of locked properties and/or properties
    that have system-wide defaults.
  * Deprecate xfconf_channel_remove_property() and
    xfconf_channel_remove_properties().
  * Change D-Bus interface to reflect above two changes.
  * Add IsPropertyLocked() to the D-Bus interface, as well as a
    corresponding xfconf_channel_is_property_locked() libxfconf function,
    which allows clients to query whether or not a property can be
    modified.
  * Don't send out a PropertyChange signal if a property is set to the
    value it already held.
  * Fix daemon crash when resetting properties recursively.
  * Fix daemon sending incorrect property names in the PropertyRemoved
    signal when removing multiple properties at once.
  * For GObject property bindings, if the bound xfconf property is
    removed from the config store, try to reset the GObject property
    to the default value specified in its GParamSpec.
  * Add -R option to xfconf-query which causes the -r option (reset) to
    operate recursively to include all properties under the specified
    property.
  * Add -a option to xfconf-query which forces setting a property as an
    array even if the array only has one element.
  * Fix xfconf_channel_get_property() so it properly converts the value
    fetched from the config store into the type that the caller
    requested (if any).


Xfce 4.6alpha (Xfce 4.5.90)
===========================

  * Initial release.  There are bugs, and the API and ABI are not frozen.
