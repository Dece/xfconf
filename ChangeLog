	  it seems like every time i get a property-changed signal, the
	  first thing i do is go and fetch the property. always sending the
	  value over the wire in the signal will generally save us a
	  round-trip when handling property changes. the downside is that

	* xfconf/xfconf-channel.c, xfconf/xfconf-channel.h,

2008-04-20  kelnos

	* common/xfconf-types.c, docs/spec/backend.txt,
	  docs/spec/perchannel-xml.txt, xfconf/xfconf-channel.c:
	  treat uint16/int16 as uint32/int32 when sending data over dbus
	  
	  annoyingly, dbus-glib doesn't support sending 16-bit signed or
	  unsigned integers over the bus, since no 16-bit GTypes exist. the
	  ability to expose custom GValue marshallers is not exposed in
	  dbus-glib's API, so custom GTypes cannot be added.
	  
	  so, internally, we handle 16-bit values as if they were 32-bit
	  values. the 16-bit types are kept so that the struct-related
	  functions still work.
	* xfconf-query/main.c:
	  use standard capital 'V' for version and lowercase 'v' for

	  make the array stuff work, in theory.
	  
	  i think this should work now. GArrays of GValues don't seem to
	  work, unfortunately, but GPtrArrays of GValues do. passing
	  GValueArrays directly to dbus-glib works, but it's difficult if
	  not impossible to figure out what they are on the other end.
	  
	  anyhow, so the array stuff works by passing a GPtrArray of
	  GValues to dbus-glib (after stuffing the GPtrArray in its own
	  GValue).
	* tests/t-set-properties.c, xfconf/xfconf-channel.c:
	  use GValueArray to set and get string lists

	  start migration to new library API with array types and struct

	  (needs some more daemon backend work), but what's in svn doesn't
	  work properly right now either
	* configure.ac.in:

	  * make _proptree_remove() remove empty parents of the node to be
	  removed
	* xfconfd/xfconf-backend-perchannel-xml.c:
	  redid perchannel-xml backend to use GNode internally for the
	  property tree rather than GTree, as GTree is just not really
	  working right here (even tho it's easier to use). GetProperty(),
	  SetProperty(), GetAllProperties(), PropertyExists(), and
	  RemoveChannel() appear to work. RemoveProperty() causes a
	  segfault, not sure why yet.
	* xfconfd/xfconf-backend.c, xfconfd/xfconf-backend.h:

	* xfconfd/xfconf-backend-perchannel-xml.c:

	  cases

2007-09-14  kelnos

	* xfconfd/xfconf-backend-perchannel-xml.c:
	  lowercase all channel/property names to enforce

	  xfconfd/xfconf-backend-perchannel-xml.c:
	  implement most of the the perchannel-xml reading and parsing
	  code. it's not complete, and it completely differs from the write
	  code (right now, it can't properly read the files it writes), and
	  there are some problems parsing string lists (sometimes), which i
	  know how to fix. also there's a new locking scheme that
	  dupilcates the functionality currently in XfceKiosk.
	  
	  regardless, it's totally not usable right now, but i need to
	  commit so i can work on this elsewhere.
