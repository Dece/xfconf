-> for version 1.0

* add kiosk/locking mechanism (mostly done)
* XfconfBackend needs to do validation on channel and property names
* unit tests (mostly done)
* MCS settings migration code
  - special backend to read config entries
  - script/c code for users who want to migrate all their settings to
    xfconf and ditch MCS entirely
* expire channels from memory if they aren't accessed for a while
* add a GetAllChannels() method to enable a gconf-editor type app
* implement the PropertyChanged signal
  - should fire whenever SetProperty() is called and a value is set.
    + optimise by checking previous value; don't fire signal if the value
      hasn't really changed.  will this slow down the daemon too much?
  - file system monitoring.  if a backend file changes, the daemon needs to
    re-read the file, but must save the old property tree so it can figure out
    what has changed so it can send appropriate PropertyChanged signals
* separate XSETTINGS daemon that reads values from xfconfd


-> for future:

* transaction support
* network support - allow remote displays and such
