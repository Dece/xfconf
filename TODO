* add kiosk/locking mechanism
* perchannel-xml backend should look in all $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and
  overlay user settings on top of system settings
* store config entries in perchannel-xml backend as a real tree rather than
  flattened (?)
* implement config store reading for perchannel-xml backend
* XfconfBackend needs to do validation on channel and property names
* transaction support (?)
* unit tests
* MCS settings migration code
* figure out how to let libxfconf know about the XfconfBackendError enum --
  maybe just rename to XfconfError and move to common/
* expire channels from memory if they aren't accessed for a while

* separate XSETTINGS daemon that reads values from xfconfd
