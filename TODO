* add kiosk/locking mechanism (mostly done)
* XfconfBackend needs to do validation on channel and property names
* transaction support (?)
* unit tests
* MCS settings migration code
* figure out how to let libxfconf know about the XfconfBackendError enum --
  maybe just rename to XfconfError and move to common/
* expire channels from memory if they aren't accessed for a while
* add a GetAllChannels() method to enable a gconf-editor type app

* separate XSETTINGS daemon that reads values from xfconfd
